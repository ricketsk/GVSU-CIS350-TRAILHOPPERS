Team name: TrailHoppers

Team members: Liam Mazure, Kassidy Ricketson, KeJuan Farrell-Bey, and Saif Fayed

# Introduction

We are going to develop an app using Python to get local trails based on your location. We plan to integrate Google maps into the app to show the trails near you. We would like to add timers to the app to keep track of how long it takes you to do the trail, and ranking based on your time and others that do the trail. We plan to implement a rating system for the trails, along with a system to tell how much traffic there is on that trail.

# Anticipated Technologies

Kivy - python framework
Google Maps (if allowed)

# Method/Approach

* We are going to start by learning how to use Kivy - find out how integrate maps into an app.
* Reseaarch and development for the demographics of who will be using the app.
* Planned weekly meetings each week for our progress and what is to come.
* Learn how to use GUIs.

# Estimated Timeline

* 2-3 Weeks to learn Kivy
* 1 week to learn map integration - and *MAYBE* using GPS
* 1-2 weeks to learn Python GUIs
* 1-2 weeks to research the demographics of who would be using the app
* 2 weeks of backend development and testing
* 2 weeks of frontend and more testing

# Anticipated Problems

* GUI
* Map integration
* Deployment
* Git problems - merging, pulling
